print('Hello World')

# introduces the "print()" function. This function requires the text you want to print in the `` inside of the () that appends the print

# expected output of code ~ Hello World

# oh, and you can also use a hastag to write comments, which give insight on the code you right and don't affect the actual code you write. Very helpful for starters.
