# Example Code for Intermediate Coders

These are some steps intermediate python coders can follow.

## Intermediate steps to take

- Pay close attention to new functions.
- Read notes (written with '#').
- Try to understand the general idea of how the code works.

As an intermediate, you should have coded for at least a month and should know the general idea of how very basic codes work. You should be able to create a very simple python coded game.
