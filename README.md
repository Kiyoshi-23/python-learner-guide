# Moony's Python Learner Guide

This handy guide is an easy way for someone with no knowledge of python or even coding can easily learn python.

## Prerequisites
You need python installed on your system ***and/or*** an IDE that can run python or has a python enabled package (if you don't know what this is, don't worry about it).

**A quick note** ~ For MAC USERS ONLY, you can download XCode from the App Store so that you have a native application to write code in

### Installing Python

## Beginners steps to take.

Take these steps after you have completed the instructions above.

- Look at the coded projects very carefully and pay attention to the notes (which are written with '#'). These introduce new functions and help you understand how to use them.
- Try to rewrite the code to understand them.
- Once you feel comfortable after coding for a while, try coding your own game or project.
-  You can also store any of your codes you work on in VS code in GitHub or on your computer as a file.
