# Moony's Python Learner Guide

This handy guide is an easy way for someone with no knowledge of python or even coding can easily learn python. 
Follow all the steps to download the correct software based on your platform below!

## Prerequisites
You need python installed on your system ***and/or*** an IDE that can run python or has a python enabled package (if you don't know what this is, don't worry about it).

>***A quick note*** ~ For MAC USERS ONLY, you can download XCode from the App Store so that you have a native application to write code in

### Installing Python

**Another note** ~ These are softwares to open your coding projects from VS code (visual studio code).

>`Windows` ~ https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows  
>`MacOS` ~ Just get XCode from the app store, or https://www.dummies.com/programming/python/how-to-install-python-on-a-mac/   
>`Linux` ~ Install the python package from your package manager like `yay` `pamac` `nix` or `apt-install`


### Installing Visual Studio Code ~ {Recommended Editor}

Visual Studio Code (or VS Code for short) is a code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It's what my personal recommendation is for beginners to coding. It can be used for about any computer language, but it's Python Package and Github Linking is what makes it stand out.

## Quick Introduction to Python 3

Python 3.0 (a.k.a. "Python 3000" or "Py3k") is a new version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed. Also, the standard library has been reorganized in a few prominent places. (sourced from https://www.python.com)

>Python 3.0 is end-of-lifed with the release of Python 3.1. All users of Python 3.0.x should upgrade to the most recent version of Python 3

## Basic Python Functions

```python
import ~ "Imports a certain library"

print() ~ "Prints a strong of text"

x = z ~ "An example of creating a variable"

while xx ~ "A While Loop. While "xx" is happening, "www" and "yyy" are also happening"
  www
  yyy
  
if xx ~ "An If Loop. If "xx" is happening, then "www" and "yyy" has to be happening"
  www
  yyy
  
x + y ~ "Adds x and y"

x - y ~ "Subtracts y from x
```
