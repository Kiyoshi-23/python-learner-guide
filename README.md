# Moony's Python Learner Guide

This handy guide is an easy way for someone with no knowledge of python or even coding can easily learn python. 
Follow all the steps to download the softwares based on your platform and begin coding!

## Prerequisites
You need python installed on your system ***and/or*** an IDE that can run python or has a python enabled package (if you don't know what this is, don't worry about it).

**A quick note** ~ For MAC USERS ONLY, you can download XCode from the App Store so that you have a native application to write code in

### Installing Python

**Another note** ~ These are softwares to open your coding projects from VS code (visual studio code).

>`Windows` - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows  
>`MacOS` - Just get XCode from the app store, or https://www.dummies.com/programming/python/how-to-install-python-on-a-mac/   
>`Linux` - Install the python package from your package manager like `yay` `pamac` `nix` or `apt-install`


### Installing Visual Studio code

Visual Studio Code (or VS Code for short) is a code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It's what my personal recommendation is for beginners to coding. It can be used for about any computer language, but it's Python Package and Github Linking is what makes it stand out.
