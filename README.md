# Moony's Python Learner Guide

This handy guide is an easy way for someone with no knowledge of python or even coding can easily learn python. 

## Prerequisites
You need python installed on your system ***and/or*** an IDE that can run python or has a python enabled package (if you don't know what this is, don't worry about it.)

**A quick note** ~ For MAC USERS ONLY, you can download XCode from the App Store so that you have a native application to write code in

### Installing Python

`Windows` - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows  
`MacOS` - Just get XCode from the Mac store, or https://www.dummies.com/programming/python/how-to-install-python-on-a-mac/   
`Linux` - Do I even have to say it? Just install the python package from your package manager like `yay` `pamac` `nix` or `apt-install`
